# CurveFinder
A project with the purpose of letting the user draw a curve and then let the program find an equation which expresses that curve.

## __TODO:__
*   ~~__Find way to let user draw on plot__~~
*   ~~__Read the coordinates where the user has drawn__~~
*   __Find mathematical way to identify if the best approach is exponential, polynomial, sinusoid ,etc__
*   __Make a asyncronus plotting showing the program approach the correct equation__
